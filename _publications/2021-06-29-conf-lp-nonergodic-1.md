In this paper, we study asymptotic properties of problems of control of stochastic discrete time systems with
time averaging and time discounting optimality criteria, and we establish that the Cesaro and Abel limits of the optimal
values in such problems can be estimated with the help of a certain infinite-dimensional (ID) linear programming (LP)
problem and its dual.
