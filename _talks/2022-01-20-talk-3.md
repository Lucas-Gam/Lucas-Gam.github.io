This talk concerned recent results showing that the set of random occupational measures generated by the state-control trajectories of a discrete-time stochastic system as well as the set of their mathematical expectations converge to a non-random, convex and compact set. We apply these results to the averaging a hybrid system with a slow continuous-time component and a fast discrete-time component. It is shown that the solutions of the hybrid system are approximated by the solutions of a differential inclusion. The novelty of our results is that we allow the state-control space of the fast component to be non-denumerable.
