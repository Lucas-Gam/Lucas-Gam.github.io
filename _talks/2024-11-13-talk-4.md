This talk described an upcoming work on the application of moment-SOS hierarchies to the generalized moment problem. In particular, we recover the convergence rates of the hierarchies of relaxations in both the optima and the feasibility sets. Applications in minimal symmetric tensor decomposition and long-run optimal control were presented.
