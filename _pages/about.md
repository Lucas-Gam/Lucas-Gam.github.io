I am a post-doctoral researcher with INRIA's Algebra, Geometry, Modeling and Algorithms team [AROMATH](https://team.inria.fr/aromath/). I was a visiting scientist at INRIA's Network Engineering and Operations [NEO](https://team.inria.fr/neo/) research team from November 2022 - January 2023. I obtained my Ph.D. in Optimal Control at Macquarie University, Sydney in October 2022. 

Research Interests
======
My Ph.D. concerned the study of the asymptotics of stochastic control systems. The key tool in the study was the transformation of such systems into infinite-dimensional linear programming systems with Borel measure decision variables. 
Currently, my work looks more generally at optimization of linear programs on measures: algorithms, convergence, and applications. Examples of problems belonging to this family include:
- Optimal control,
- Tensor decomposition,
- Volume computation,
- Polynomial optimization.
